                <p>Pizza Co. was founded in 1973 in the heart of Naples, Italy—the birthplace of pizza—by brothers Marco and Luca Bellini. With a family recipe passed down through generations and a dream of sharing authentic Neapolitan pizza with the world, the Bellinis opened a small pizzeria nestled between the cobbled streets and bustling markets of their hometown. Using only locally sourced San Marzano tomatoes, hand-stretched dough, and wood-fired ovens, they crafted each pie with precision and passion. Word of their mouthwatering margaritas and crispy crusts spread quickly, turning a humble neighborhood spot into a beloved destination for locals and tourists alike.
